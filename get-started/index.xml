      <description>This section will explain why the Managed IoT Cloud platform (short: MIC) is a powerful tool for managing your IoT infrastructure and why you should consider using it for your projects.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with a quick background about the MIC platform and who operates it to get you oriented.
Telenor Connexion: Development Telenor Connexion is a branch in the Telenor company with its headquarters in Stockholm, Sweden. Telenor Connexion focuses on tailored IoT solutions and maintains the MIC platform.</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;re probably wondering &amp;ldquo;what does MIC has to offer for me?&amp;rdquo;.
There are several components, both known and unknown to most of us, when creating a full-blown IoT infrastructure. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to say &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll just spin up a SQL database and pipe all my data to it&amp;rdquo;, but how will you connect your IoT devices through LoRaWAN / NB-IoT, handle realtime updates, structure a fleet of e.g. 100+ IoT devices and query gigabytes of data stored years ago?</description>

      <description>The RESTful API makes it possible to use a wide variety of technologies to utilize the MIC platform. As long as you can make HTTP-calls you&amp;rsquo;re good to go.
In the following workshops we&amp;rsquo;ll use Node.js with the Vue.js JavaScript framework. It&amp;rsquo;s fast to get started with and building a functioning application.
Installing Node.js The easies way of getting Node.js is to install the Node Version Manager (NVM). Head over to their GitHub page for instructions on how to install it for your preferred platform.</description>
